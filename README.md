# Moving Shapes Dataset Generator

This script generates simple 2D clips of geometric shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) that move, rotate, and scale across a series of frames. It was developed for asserting models that require coherent motion data, such as interpolation models.

## âœ¨ Features

- Randomized shape generation with:
  - Translation (movement)
  - Rotation
  - Scaling
- Supports: 
  - Circles â—¯
  - Rectanglesã€€â—»
  - Trianglesã€€âŠ¿ã€€
- Configurable image size, number of frames, motion intensity, and shape properties.
- Outputs each clip as a set of images in `outputs/prueba/clip_a`.
